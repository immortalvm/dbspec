# The idea with this file was to "port" befolkning.dbspec to Windows +
# PowerShell and verify that we get the same result, but so far we have
# only had time to check that we are able to use PowerShell in embedded
# scripts and connect to a MariaDB instance running in a WSL instance.

Parameters:
	host - Hostname of MariaDB instance used for the staging database
	port - Port of MariaDB instance
	user
	password

# Here -f is optional. We include it to show that we split the interpreter
# string at spaces (on non-Posix systems). Quoting is not (yet) supported.
# Hence, it is not possible to use an interpreter with spaces in the path.
